## Hypothesis Testing & Acceptable Error

### Topics
- What is null hypothesis and why it is important?
- Null hypothesis  by example
  - Real life examples, rain dance
  - Industrial examples, A/B testing
- Procedures to calculate z-score in order to accept or reject null hypothesis

### Learning Objectives (Competencies)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify when and how apply null Hypothesis
2. What are the metrics we need in order to statistically accept or reject null  
3. How and when use Z test or T test
4. Whether or not two samples are different

### Activities
- Reminder for Z distribution, and ask student to verify Z distribution is standard normal, CDF and survival function review (10 min)
- Show the table of examples for null statement, explain the first 2-3 (5 min)
- TT: what is null Hypothesis by mentioning drug effect example what is z-score? (20 min)
- TT: Why learn null hypothesis? (10 min)
- TT: How to calculate p-value from z-score? (5 min)  
- Ask students to do the first challenge  (10 min)
- Break (10 min)
- TT: Possible errors that can happen when accept or reject null hypothesis (5 min)
- Ask students to do the second challenge (10 min)
- TT: When use Z test and T test (5 min)
- Ask student to do third challenge (10 min)
- TT: What is one-tail or two-tail calculation for p-value? (5 min)
- Read and discuss [Z and T test](http://iaingallagher.tumblr.com/post/50980987285/t-tests-in-python) (10 min)
- Wrap up, homework explanation (5 min)

### Resources
- Link to additional articles and videos
- Attribute authors and give descriptive titles
  -  Read this blog from iaingallagher [Z and T test in Python](http://iaingallagher.tumblr.com/post/50980987285/t-tests-in-python)
  - Read Jeff Groff's [article on null hypothesis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jgroff/unit-3-hypothesis-testing)
  - More numerical examples on [Hypothesis Testing with the Z score](http://jukebox.esc13.net/untdeveloper/RM/Stats_Module_4/mobile_pages/Stats_Module_48.html)



### Challenges
- Write a function the takes the mean of population, significant level and the samples as the input argument then decide to reject or accept the null hypothesis
- Compare their calculation with methods available in stats module in scipy
- Write a function that determine whether use z-score or t-test in order to accept or reject null Hypothesis
- Link to challenges in [Jupyter notebooks](../Notebooks/HypothesisTesting.ipynb)

### Stretch Challenges
- Homework: [apply null hypothesis to these problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ITryiXU_VoyBvtZY4deehk4PmlieSlF7rSNc8sBU3Sw/edit)

## Hypothesis Testing & Acceptable Error

### Topics
- What is null hypothesis and why it is important?
- Null hypothesis  by example
  - Real life examples
  - Industrial examples
- Procedures to calculate z-score in order to accept or reject null hypothesis

### Learning Objectives (Competencies)
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify when and how apply null Hypothesis
2. What are the metrics we need in order to statistically accept or reject null  
3. How and when use Z test or T test
4. Whether or not two samples are different

### Activities
- Start with why - to motivate topics (5 min)
- Think, pair, share on topic 1 (10 min)
- Lecture following [slides on topic 1 and 2](URL-here) (20 min)
- I do, we do, you do on topic 2 (20 min)
- Break (5 min)
- Read and discuss [article on topic 3](URL-here) (20 min)
- Pair program on challenges listed below (30 min)

### Resources
- Link to additional articles and videos
- Attribute authors and give descriptive titles
  -  Read this blog from iaingallagher [Z and T test in Python](http://iaingallagher.tumblr.com/post/50980987285/t-tests-in-python)
  - Read Jeff Groff's [article on null hypothesis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jgroff/unit-3-hypothesis-testing)
  - More numerical examples on [Hypothesis Testing with the Z score](http://jukebox.esc13.net/untdeveloper/RM/Stats_Module_4/mobile_pages/Stats_Module_48.html)



### Challenges
- Write a function the takes the mean of population, significant level and the samples as the    input argument then decide to reject or accept the null hypothesis
- Compare their calculation with methods available in stats module in scipy
- Write a function that determine whether use z-score or t-test in order to accept or reject null Hypothesis
- Link to challenges in [Jupyter notebooks like this](../Notebooks/HypothesisTesting.ipynb)

### Stretch Challenges
- Homework ()
